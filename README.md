## Inspiration
To begin, there is **BNPL services are becoming increasingly popular around the world**, with more than a third of US customers having used them in some form. First and foremost, according to the BNPL provider split, the **largest difficulty is how to recoup lost ecommerce sales**. Third, the **growing popularity of younger consumers** and those with thin credit histories.

## What it does
We provide an **innovative approach to financing** here. Our solution is called **CreDAO**, which drives the **decentralised consumer credit**. The concept is to introduce cryptocurrency into the **BNPL realm**. Cryptocurrency-accepting systems should be supported using the **BNPL approach**, just as the **TradFi** world is.

Our solution utilizes the **features of NFTs to enrich our solution further digitizing and securing the rewards and offers for the customers**. Lets take a look at the overall process.

Customers use the CreDAO platforms for their transactions **online or offline by scanning QR code of the merchants or retailers**.
One the CreDAO transaction completes and the **NFT Tokens as rewards are credited to customers wallet for future use**. Customer can either **use those NFT tokens or trade them online** to amplify the gains from his transaction. This service allows for **greater transparency and security of buying, selling, and lending of physical goods as well as digital goods and assets**.
A large majority of NFTs today are digital assets, and we feel this technology is being greatly under-utilized at the moment. With funders we are striving for **optimal integration of BNPL, KardiaChain and NFTs for benefits of customer today and in future**.

CreDAO is a decentralized exchange protocol that runs on the **BNPL platform**, which is built on the KardiaChain blockchain. CreDAO is a **forward-thinking** platform that aims to share advantages with all participants. We are aiming to create a **market for everyday transactions and micropayments using Crypto and BNPL**. The platform includes third-party applications, merchants, online retail stores, and the world's most well-known staking mechanism. Introducing the **CreDAO token**, a reward system based on predefined events such as purchase or instalment payment. CreDAO brings two distinct sets of capabilities.

Integrated wallets for KardiaChain, ETHERUM, and AURORA, as well as relevant defi capabilities such as transaction visibility, wallet transfer, and yield staking.
CreDAO tokens will be used to **integrate the BNPL paradigm for cryptocurrencies**.
The application displays transactions for each cryptocurrency, including KardiaChain, Ethereum, and Aurora. Additionally, the app includes filters and search capabilities for transactions. **Transfer enables the exchange of tokens** across linked wallets and with CreDAO. The CreDAO Wallet tab displays a dashboard that displays the available CreDAO tokens in the form of a balance, a limit, and spent tokens. This dashboard establishes restrictions on an individual's **BNPL credit** for ecommerce transactions, whether online or in-person. This way, the customer has the choice of paying using available tokens in their KardiaChain, Ethereum, or AURORA wallets or with **CreDAO tokens via the BNPL channel**. In the event of the BNPL option, repayment can be made via a pre-defined EMI. This can be accomplished using the wallet's available currency or their debit or credit cards. **Users receive benefits in the form of CreDAO tokens following installment**. CreDAO offers different methods of earning CreDAO NFT tokens. The CreDAO NFT tokens Points earned will vary between different cards based on transaction categories such as shopping at partner stores, partner restaurants, other dining expenses, entertainment and so on.

This is accomplished through an **established technology stack that enables us to operate with the agility, scale, and ease of integration required in an ecosystem**. Outsystems is a low-code platform that enables the delivery of experiences to users across many channels â€“ web, mobile Android, and iOS. Node.js is used to construct APIs on top of the KardiaChain blockchain, which may be consumed by an ecommerce platform or the CreDAO app, depending on the demoed functionalities. Balance and transfer APIs have been developed, as well as an **underlying KardiaChain API that is based on the KardiaChain account ID**.

##Challenges we ran into
Initially, bringing numerous wallet coins to CreDAO as a **unified platform** presented some issues. Through CreDAO, we were able to integrate KardiaChain, Ethereum, and Aurora chains into the solution for the Hackathon. We linked OutSystems' low-code platform with the KardiaChain environment to enable API-driven transactions. Initially, we encountered integration challenges, but we were able to integrate our application quickly.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
CreDAO's extensibility allows for the addition of other wallets and interoperability with e-commerce systems such as Amazon, Shopify, and others. CreDAO was conceptualised and implemented as an additional token to complement BNPL's methods of financing in order to target untapped shoppers. Aligned with Web 3.0 standards, with transparency, openness, and scalability at its core

##What we learned
About the world of cryptocurrency and how it may be used in real-world circumstances, particularly in finance, with CreDAO

## What's next for CreDAO
Establish guidelines to facilitate open integration among ecommerce operators for the purpose of bundling BNPL via CreDAO.
